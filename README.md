Flashcards for Trello
====================

Flashcards for Trello allows you to use the power of Trello boards to manage your flashcards.
Whether you're learning a new language, memorising formulas, or studying for an exam â€“ Flashcards
for Trello has got you covered!

Use Trello to create and edit your flashcards. Flashcards for Trello will then use your personal
lists to create a powerful learning experience. The title of a card is used as the question, it's
description as the answer. Flashcard for Trello also support images and (optionally) MathML for
mathematic formulas!

Flashcards for Trello also moves cards to new lists if you have answered them correctly. This allows
the usage of a sophisticated memorising system like spaced repetition or the
[Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system).
